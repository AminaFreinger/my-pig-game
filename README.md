# Game Rules
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- The player looses his current score when one of the dices is 1. After that, it's the next player's turn
- A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
- In the input field players can change the winning score. The first player to reach the specified winning score or 100 points (if the default winning score was not changed) on GLOBAL score wins the game.
